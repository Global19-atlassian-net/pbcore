The pbcore Python package contains essential tools for interacting
with PacBio data. The package can be installed like most normal Python
packages, i.e., 

python setup.py install

or 

make install

This package should work with Python versions 2.6 and
2.7. Additionally, This package depends on the h5py and numpy python
packages which need to be installed separately. Currently, we have
tested with:

h5py  : h5py-1.3.1 and h5py-2.0.1
numpy : numpy-1.6.0

Additional packages are required to run the tests, generate the
documentation, and fully utilize some of the functionality in the
package.

nose     : nose-1.1.2
argparse : argparse-1.2.1
Sphinx   : Sphinx-1.1.2
